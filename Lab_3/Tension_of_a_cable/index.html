  <h3>Tension of a cable</h3>
  <p>A 200-pound object is to be hung from the end of a rigid 8-foot horizontal pole of negligible weight, as shown in the figure below.
  The pole is attached to a wall by a pivot and is supported by an 8-foot cable that is attached to the wall at a higher point.
  The tension on this cable is given by the equation:</p>
  $$ T= \frac{W \times l_c \times l_p}{d \sqrt{l_p^2-d^2}} $$
  <p>where \(T \) is the tension of the cable, \( W \) is the weight of the object, \( l_c \) is the length of the cable, \(l_p \) is the
  length of the pole, and \( d \) is the distance along the pole at which the cable is attached.</p>
