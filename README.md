This repository contains the exercises done on Computer Science on the first year of industrial engineering at Universitat Jaume I (UJI) in Castellon.

The programming language used for these exercises is: Javascript. Those scripts are combined with HTML and CSS files so as to create websites for different purposes.

## Exercises
### Area of a triangle
This exercise is included inside GeometryApp project. It consists of a simple script which calculates the area of a triangle with the base and height of a triangle.

### Arkanoid
Arkanoid was the final project of the subject developped by a group of six people. This is the final version of our game.
In general, the game is fully functional. However, sometimes depending on where the ball rebounds on the blocks, the detection of the impact may not work in an accurate way. 

### Australia
This is not a project concerning Computer Science. In fact, this is a project carried out by 4 people for English course, in which we were promoting a travel to Australia. Therefore, as we were learning to create websites, we decided to make one, just for fun.

Some links may not be working because they depend on websites created by other members of the group and their Altervista accounts have been deleted.

Under construction!
