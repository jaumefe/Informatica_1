This repository contains the exercises done on Computer Science on the first year of industrial engineering at Universitat Jaume I (UJI) in Castellon.

The programming language used for these exercises is: Javascript. Those scripts are combined with HTML and CSS files so as to create websites for different purposes.

The list of exercises done are included here:
* Area of a triangle
* Arkanoid
* Australia
* Currency converter
* Distance in the plane
* Ellipse
* Formula
* Geometry App
* Graphs
* Lab_1
* Lab_3
* Lab_4
* Lab_5
* My first web page
* Polar rose
* Programming exercises
* Radio receiver
* Surface of a cylinder
* Torus

## Exercises
### Area of a triangle
This exercise is included inside GeometryApp project. It consists of a simple script which calculates the area of a triangle with the base and height of a triangle.

### Arkanoid
Arkanoid was the final project of the subject developped by a group of six people. This is the final version of our game.
In general, the game is fully functional. However, sometimes depending on where the ball rebounds on the blocks, the detection of the impact may not work in an accurate way. 

### Australia
This is not a project concerning Computer Science. In fact, this is a project carried out by 4 people for English course, in which we were promoting a travel to Australia. Therefore, as we were learning to create websites, we decided to make one, just for fun.
Some links may not be working because they depend on websites created by other members of the group and their Altervista accounts have been deleted.

There are some pages containing information about landmarks of Australia and a currency converter from Australian dollars to euros.

### Currency converter
A currency converter which works with a given exchange rate. It is contained among the exercises corresponding to Laboratory 1.

### Distance in the plane
A simply program which computes the distance in the plane of two points.
It also corresponds to an exercise of Laboratory 1.

### Ellipse
This exercise is included inside GeometryApp project. It is a script which calculates the area of an ellipse from both semi-axes of the ellipse.

### Formula
It is an exercise to learn how to write formula on website by using Mathjax. There are three different formulae to write.

### GeometryApp
An application to compute different geometrical properties (area, perimeter, surface and volume) of some figures. This project has been done on a group of six people, whose names are included in the main page of the App.
