## Exercises
### Area of a triangle
This exercise is included inside GeometryApp project. It consists of a simple script which calculates the area of a triangle with the base and height of a triangle.

### Arkanoid
Arkanoid was the final project of the subject developped by a group of six people. This is the final version of our game.
In general, the game is fully functional. However, sometimes depending on where the ball rebounds on the blocks, the detection of the impact may not work in an accurate way. 

Under construction!
